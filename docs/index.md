## Overview
Engine3D exists to help rroviding students to being able to learn how to architecturally develop complex subsystems to develop, providing solutions to widely variations of problems.

Engine3D's design rules should be:

1. Portable and Cross-platform support.
2. OS Platform-agnostic.
3. Safe, Reliable, and Testable or can be Tested.
4. Easy builds.

## Basics
Engine3D is a multipurpose open source engine. Used for game development, animations, film-making, and running simulations. At the core of Engine3D will be our internal architectures for boilerplate foundations, graphics api-agnostic API's, UI wrapper, and code-specific runtime utilities, loggers, and other implementations. Decoupling to enable application to be generic enough allowing users and students alike to build applications for certain targeted platforms.
