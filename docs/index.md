## Overview
Engine3D exists to help students to be able to learn how to architecturally develop complex subsystems, providing solutions to wide variations of problems.

Engine3D's design rules should be:

1. Portable and Cross-platform support.
2. OS Platform-agnostic.
3. Graphics API-agnostic rendering
4. Safe, Reliable, and Testable or can be Tested.
5. Easy build.

## Basics
Engine3D is a multipurpose open-source engine. They are used for game development, animations, film-making, and running simulations. At the core of Engine3D will be our internal architectures for boilerplate foundations, graphics API-agnostic APIs, UI wrappers, and code-specific runtime utilities, loggers, and other implementations. Decoupling to enable applications to be generic enough allowing users and students alike to build applications for certain targeted platforms.

## What and Why?
Around last year, I decided to build a game engine that was going to be used to develop a 2D/3D rendering. Then created this project out of passion for developing not just games, but also allowing to run animations, simulations, and various other systems in engine architecture. While having the ability to create a  multipurpose engine using internal technologies integrated into this engine.

### Some features
* Written in C++ with supporting Windows and Linux.
* C# .NET Core scripting (like Unity).
* Vulkan/DirectX/Metal for rendering with an API-agnostic renderer.
* Multi-threaded runtime (main thread + render thread).
* Physically-based forward + HDR Rendering
* Animations + Simulations
