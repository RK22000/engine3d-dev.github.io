## Build and Running

### Visual Studio Code
Assuming that all prerequisites are already installed, proceeding to the following:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sfsu-dev/engine3d`
2. Installing dependencies using conan: `conan install . --build=missing`
3. Running the build: `conan build .`
4. Your executable to run the basic program would be from Sandbox in `build/Release/Sandbox/Sandbox.exe`
  * If running with Visual Studio then make sure that is installed and run the build process
  * Once generated the solutions file, run that solutions file in Visual Studio.

## 1.) Working with Engine3D
* Still in progress
